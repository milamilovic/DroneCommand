# DroneCommand
DroneCommand is an interactive control station for managing unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), featuring real-time map visualization, flight control, battery monitoring, no-fly zone management, and collision detection for seamless and safe drone operations.

## Features and Components
1. LED Indicators
Purpose: Display the activity status of two UAVs.
Behavior:
Dark color: UAV is inactive.
Bright color: UAV is active.

2. Topographic Map
Display: A textured representation of Mount Majevica and surrounding municipalities.
Design: Rendered with a greenish glass overlay for a technological aesthetic.

4. No-Fly Zone
Location: Positioned over the municipality of Lopare.
Appearance: Semi-transparent circular overlay.
Interactivity:
Move:
Drag with the left mouse button to reposition the zone.
Release the button to set the new position. UAVs encountered during dragging are destroyed.

#### Moved no fly zone

Reset: Press the R key to reset the position and size of the zone.

6. Battery Levels
Display: Two progress bars show the battery percentage of each UAV.
Details:
The percentage value is displayed in the center of each bar.
XY coordinates of each UAV are displayed below their respective bars.
Behavior:
Batteries deplete gradually while UAVs are active.
UAVs with empty batteries are destroyed and deactivated.

5. UAV Representation
Elements: Two circles represent the UAVs.
Behavior:
Initial State: Both UAVs are grounded (inactive), with full batteries.
Activation:
1 + U: Activates the first UAV.
2 + U: Activates the second UAV.
Deactivation:
1 + I: Deactivates the first UAV.
2 + I: Deactivates the second UAV.
Movement:
W, S, A, D: Controls the first UAV when active.
Arrow keys: Controls the second UAV when active.

#### Moving the drone

Collision Handling:
If UAVs collide, move out of the map, enter the no-fly zone, or run out of battery, they are destroyed (removed from the map and permanently deactivated).
